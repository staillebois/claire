### Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is a server that allows you to run LLMs locally on your machine. There are two options depending on your setup: local installation (recommended) or using Docker.

In addition to installing Ollama, you need to download [Nomic](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text), A high-performing open embedding model with a large token context window that can run on modest configurations.

<details>
    <summary><b>Local Installation (recommended)</b></summary>

This installation will allow Ollama to [take advantage of the GPU](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/gpu.md) on your machine. Follow the instructions at [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download).

Once installed and running, download the model with `ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest`.

To chat with the model, run `ollama run nomic-embed-text:latest` and say something, for example, "Hello, how are you?"

<details>
    <summary><b>Installation with Docker</b></summary>

If local installation is not possible, run Ollama by executing the following command:

```

```

Once running, load the model with

```
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
```
